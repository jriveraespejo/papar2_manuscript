\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

In \emph{comparative judgment} (CJ) studies, judges assess a specific
trait or attribute across various stimuli by performing pairwise
comparisons \citep{Thurstone_1927a, Thurstone_1927b}. Each comparison
produces a dichotomous outcome, indicating which stimulus is perceived
to exhibit a higher trait level. For example, when assessing text
quality, judges compare pairs of written texts (the stimuli) to
determine the relative quality each text exhibit (the trait)
\citep{Laming_2004, Pollitt_2012b, Whitehouse_2012, vanDaal_et_al_2016, Lesterhuis_2018_thesis, Coertjens_et_al_2017, Goossens_et_al_2018, Bouwer_et_al_2023}.

Numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of CJ in assessing
traits and competencies over the past decade. These studies have
emphasized three aspects of the method's effectiveness: its reliability,
validity, and practical applicability. Research on reliability indicates
that CJ requires a relatively small number of pairwise comparisons
\citep{Verhavert_et_al_2019, Crompvoets_et_al_2022} to produce trait
scores that are as precise and consistent as those generated by other
assessment methods
\citep{Coertjens_et_al_2017, Goossens_et_al_2018, Bouwer_et_al_2023}.
Furthermore, evidence suggests that the reliability and time efficiency
of CJ are comparable, if not superior, to those of other assessment
methods when employing adaptive comparison algorithms
\citep{Pollitt_2012b, Verhavert_et_al_2022, Mikhailiuk_et_al_2021}.
Meanwhile, research on validity suggests that scores generated by CJ can
accurately represent the traits under measurement
\citep{Whitehouse_2012, vanDaal_et_al_2016, Lesterhuis_2018_thesis, Bartholomew_et_al_2018, Bouwer_et_al_2023},
while research on practical applicability highlights the method's
versatility across both educational and non-educational contexts
\citep{Kimbell_2012, Jones_et_al_2015, Bartholomew_et_al_2018, Jones_et_al_2019, Marshall_et_al_2020, Bartholomew_et_al_2020, Boonen_et_al_2020}.

Nevertheless, despite the increasing number of CJ studies, unsystematic
and fragmented research approaches have left several critical issues
unaddressed. The present study primarily focuses on two: the
overreliance on the assumptions of Thurstone's Case V in the statistical
analysis of CJ data, and the apparent disconnect between CJ's approach
to trait measurement and hypothesis testing. The following sections
begin with a brief overview of Thurstone's theory and a detailed
examination of these issues. Subsequently, the study introduces a
theoretical model for CJ that builds upon Thurstone's theory, alongside
its statistical translation, designed to address the two concerns
simultaneously.

\section{Thurstone's theory}\label{sec-thurstone_theory}

In its most general form, Thurstone's theory addresses pairwise
comparisons of stimuli made by a single judge
\citep[pp.~267]{Thurstone_1927b}. The theory posits that two key factors
determine the dichotomous outcome of these comparisons: the discriminal
process of each stimulus and their discriminal difference. The
\emph{discriminal process} represents the psychological impact each
stimulus has on judges or, more simply, their perception of the stimulus
trait. According to the theory, the discriminal process for each
stimulus follows a Normal distribution, where its mode (mean), called
the \emph{modal discriminal process}, indicates the stimulus position on
the trait continuum, while its dispersion, known as the
\emph{discriminal dispersion}, reflects variability in the perceived
trait of the stimulus.

Figure~\ref{fig-discriminal_process} illustrates the discriminal
processes along a quality trait continuum for two written texts. The
figure shows that these processes individually follow a Normal
distribution. Furthermore, it shows that the modal discriminal process
for Text B is positioned further along the continuum than Text A
\((S_{B} > S_{A})\). Additionally, the figure highlights the broader
distribution of Text B compared to Text A as a result of its larger
discriminal dispersion \((\sigma_{B} > \sigma_{A})\).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/figures/discriminal_process.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-discriminal_process}Discriminal processes for two
written texts}

\end{figure}%

However, since the discriminal processes of the stimuli are not directly
observable, the theory introduces the \emph{law of comparative
judgment}. This law states that in pairwise comparisons, a judge
perceives the stimulus positioned further along the trait continuum as
having a higher level of that trait. This law emphasizes that the
relative distance between stimuli, rather than their absolute positions
on the continuum, determines the outcome of the pairwise comparison.
Indeed, the theory assumes that the observed dichotomous outcome arises
from the difference between the underlying discriminal processes of the
stimuli, referred to as the \emph{discriminal difference}. Since the
individual discriminal processes follow a Normal distribution, the
discriminal difference also follows a Normal distribution
\citep{Andrich_1978}. In this distribution, the mode (mean) represents
the relative separation between the stimuli and the dispersion captures
the variability of that relative separation.

Figure~\ref{fig-discriminal_difference} illustrates the distribution of
the discriminal difference for the texts presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-discriminal_process}. The figure indicates that the
judge perceives Text B as having significantly higher quality than Text
A. This conclusion is evident from the positive difference in the modal
discriminal processes of the texts \((S_{B} - S_{A} > 0)\) and the area
under the curve where the discriminal difference distinctly favors Text
B over Text A, denoted as \(P(B > A)\) (shaded gray area). As a result,
the dichotomous outcome of this comparison is more likely to favor Text
B over Text A.

\section{The two critical issues in CJ
literature}\label{sec-theory-issues}

This section examines the two critical issues in the CJ literature that
serve as the primary focus of this study. The first is the overreliance
on Thurstone's Case V assumptions in the statistical analysis of CJ
data. The second is the apparent disconnect between CJ's approach to
trait measurement and hypothesis testing.

\subsection{The Case V and the statistical analysis of CJ
data}\label{sec-theory-issue1}

The previous section outlines the general form of Thurstone's theory,
which applies to a CJ design where a single judge evaluates multiple
stimuli. For the practical application of the theory, Thurstone
developed four additional cases derived from this general form, where
each successive case incorporates additional simplifying assumptions.
Case I represents the general form of the theory. Case II extends this
by allowing multiple judges to make comparisons rather than restricting
the comparisons to a single judge. Case III introduces the assumption of
zero correlation between stimuli. Case IV builds on this by assuming the
stimuli have similar dispersions. Finally, Case V replaces this
assumption with the condition that the stimuli have equal discriminal
dispersions. Table~\ref{tbl-thurstone_cases} summarizes these cases and
their assumptions. For a detailed discussion of this progression, refer
to \citet{Thurstone_1927b} and \citet[pp.~248-253]{Bramley_2008}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-thurstone_cases}Thurstones cases and asumptions}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/tables/thurstone_cases.png}

}

\end{table}%

Despite its reliance on the largest number of simplifying assumptions
\citetext{\citealp[pp.~253]{Bramley_2008}; \citealp[pp.~677]{Kelly_et_al_2022}},
Case V remains the most widely used case in the CJ literature. This
popularity stems mainly from its simplified statistical representation
in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model
\citep{Bradley_et_al_1952, Luce_1959}. The BTL model mirrors the
assumptions of Case V, with one key difference: while Case V assumes a
Normal distribution for the stimuli's discriminal processes, the BTL
model uses the more mathematically tractable Logistic distribution
\citep[pp.~254]{Andrich_1978, Bramley_2008} (see
Table~\ref{tbl-thurstone_cases}). This substitution has little impact on
the model's estimation or interpretation, as the Normal and Logistic
distributions share similar statistical properties, differing only by a
scaling factor of approximately \(1.7\)
\citep[pp.~16]{vanderLinden_et_al_2017_I} (see
Figure~\ref{fig-logistic_vs_normal}).

\end{figure}%

Nevertheless, Thurstone originally developed Case V to provide a
``rather coarse scaling'' of traits \citep[pp.~269]{Thurstone_1927b},
prioritizing statistical simplicity over precision in trait measurement
\citep[pp.~677]{Kelly_et_al_2022}. He explicitly warned against its
untested application, stating that its use ``should not be made without
(an) experimental test'' \citep[pp.~270]{Thurstone_1927b}, acknowledging
that some assumptions might be problematic when complex traits or
heterogeneous stimuli are involved \citep[pp.~376]{Thurstone_1927a}.
Consequently, given that modern CJ applications frequently involve such
traits and stimuli, two main assumptions of Case V and, by extension, of
the BTL model may not consistently hold in theory or practice: the
assumption of equal dispersion and zero correlation between stimuli.

\subsubsection{The assumption of equal dispersions between
stimuli}\label{sec-theory-issue1a}

The discriminal dispersions of stimuli are crucial in determining the
dichotomous outcomes of pairwise comparisons. Discrepancies in these
dispersions shape the distribution of the discriminal difference,
directly influencing the comparison outcome. Figure~\ref{fig-dispersion}
illustrates how more uncertainty in the trait perception of one text
relative to another broadens the distribution of their discriminal
difference. This broadening affects the area under the curve where the
discriminal difference distinctly favors one text over the other,
\(P(B > A)\). Additionally, the figure shows that when the discriminal
dispersions of the texts are equal \((\sigma_{B}-\sigma_{A}=0)\), the
discriminal difference is more likely to favor one text over the other
than when their dispersions differ (shaded gray area).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/figures/dispersion.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dispersion}The effect of different dispersions
between stimuli on the distribution of the discriminal difference}

\end{figure}%

However, Thurstone contended that the assumption of equal dispersions
may not hold when researchers assess complex traits or heterogeneous
stimuli \citep[pp.~376]{Thurstone_1927a}, as these traits and stimuli
can introduce judgment discrepancies due to their unique features
\citep{vanDaal_et_al_2016, Lesterhuis_2018, Chambers_et_al_2022}.
Indeed, evidence of such violation may already exist in the CJ
literature as misfit statistics. These statistics measure the judgment
discrepancies associated with a given stimulus
\citetext{\citealp[pp.~12]{Pollitt_2004}; \citealp[pp.~20]{Goossens_et_al_2018}}.
For instance, labeling texts as ``misfits'' indicates that comparisons
involving these texts result in more judgment discrepancies than others
\citep{Pollitt_2012a, Pollitt_2012b, vanDaal_et_al_2016, Goossens_et_al_2018}.
This finding implies that discriminal differences associated with
``misfits'' texts usually display a broader dispersion, suggesting that
their discriminal processes also exhibit more variation than other
texts. Notably, this reasoning also applies to ``misfit'' judges, whose
evaluations reflect substantial deviations from the shared consensus due
to the unique characteristics of the stimuli or the judges themselves.
Moreover, the presence of these ``misfit'' judges and their deviations
can introduce additional statistical and measurement issues, as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec-theory-issue1b}.

Therefore, assuming equal dispersions between stimuli, despite its
violation, can cause Case V (and the BTL model) to inflate the
reliability of the comparison outcome. Moreover, ignoring the difference
in dispersions can lead to the neglect of critical differences in the
reliability of the trait across stimuli, resulting in inaccurate
conclusions about the trait's estimates \citep[pp.~370]{McElreath_2020}.
Furthermore, if researchers acknowledge that misfit statistics help
identify these critical differences, the usual practice in the CJ
literature of excluding stimuli based on these statistics
\citep{Pollitt_2012b, vanDaal_et_al_2017, Goossens_et_al_2018} risks
discarding valuable information and introducing bias into the trait's
estimates \citep[chap.~12]{Zimmerman_1994, McElreath_2020}. The
direction and magnitude of these biases are unpredictable, as they
depend on the specific stimuli researchers exclude from the analysis.
Together, these oversights undermine the reliability of the trait and
ultimately compromise its validity \citep[pp.~2]{Perron_et_al_2015}.

\subsubsection{The assumption of zero correlation between
stimuli}\label{sec-theory-issue1b}

Similar to the discriminal dispersions, the correlation between
discriminal processes plays a crucial role in determining the
dichotomous outcomes of pairwise comparisons. This correlation also
shapes the distribution of the discriminal difference, directly
influencing the comparison outcome. Figure~\ref{fig-correlation}
illustrates how the dependence in trait perception between two texts
narrows the distribution of their discriminal difference. This narrowing
affects the area under the curve where the discriminal difference
distinctly favors one text over the other, \(P(B>A)\). Moreover, the
figure shows that when two texts are independent or uncorrelated
\((\rho=0)\), their discriminal difference is less likely to favor one
text over the other than when the texts are highly correlated (shaded
gray area).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/figures/correlation.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-correlation}The effect of correlation on the
distribution of the discriminal difference}

\end{figure}%

Notably, Thurstone's Case V and the BTL model assume independent trait
perceptions across stimuli. Thurstone attributed this independence to
the cancellation of potential judges' biases, driven by two opposing and
equally weighted effects occurring during the pairwise comparisons
\citep[pp.~268]{Thurstone_1927b}. \citet{Andrich_1978} mathematically
demonstrated this cancellation using the BTL model under the assumption
of discriminal processes with additive biases. However, it is easy to
imagine at least two scenarios where the zero correlation assumption
almost certainly does not hold: when the pairwise comparison involves
multidimensional, complex traits with heterogeneous stimuli and when an
additional hierarchical structure is relevant to the stimuli.

In the first scenario, the intricate aspects of multidimensional,
complex traits may introduce dependencies between the stimuli due to
certain judges' biases that resist cancellation. Research on text
quality suggests that when judges evaluate these traits, they often rely
on various intricate characteristics of the stimuli to form their
judgments
\citep{vanDaal_et_al_2016, Lesterhuis_2018, Chambers_et_al_2022}. These
additional relevant characteristics, which are unlikely to be equally
weighted or opposing, can unevenly influence judges' perceptions,
creating biases in their judgments and, ultimately, introducing
dependencies between stimuli
\citep[pp.~346]{vanderLinden_et_al_2017_II}. For example, this could
occur when a judge assessing the argumentative quality of a text places
more weight on its grammatical accuracy than other judges, ultimately
favoring texts with fewer errors but weaker arguments. While direct
evidence for this specific scenario is lacking, studies such as
\citet{Pollitt_et_al_2003} demonstrate the presence of such biases,
supporting the idea that the factors influencing pairwise comparisons
may not always cancel out.

In the second scenario, the shared context or inherent connections
created by additional hierarchical structures may further introduce
dependencies between stimuli, a statistical phenomenon commonly known as
clustering \citep{Everitt_et_al_2010}. Although the CJ literature
acknowledges the presence of such hierarchical structures, the
statistical handling of this extra source of dependency between stimuli
has been inadequate. For example, when CJ data includes multiple samples
of stimuli from the same individuals, researchers often rely on
(average) estimated BTL scores to conduct subsequent analyses and tests
at the individual hierarchical level
\citep{Bramley_et_al_2019, Boonen_et_al_2020, Bouwer_et_al_2023, vanDaal_et_al_2017, Jones_et_al_2019, Gijsen_et_al_2021}.
This approach, however, can introduce additional statistical and
measurement issues, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec-theory-issue2}.

In any case, the psychometric and statistical literature emphasizes the
need to address factors that create dependencies between stimuli, as
failing to do so can affect the reliability of the comparison outcomes
and lead to inaccurate conclusions about the trait's estimates. For
instance, researchers who overlook additional relevant traits, such as
judges' biases, can cause dimensional mismatches in the statistical
model used for analysis. This mismatch can artificially inflate the
reliability of the trait \citep[pp.~341]{Hoyle_et_al_2023} or, even
worse, introduce bias into the trait's estimates \citep{Ackerman_1989}.
Furthermore, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec-theory-issue1a},
researchers who exclude judges based on misfit statistics can risk
discarding valuable information, further biasing the trait's estimates
\citep[chap.~12]{Zimmerman_1994, McElreath_2020}. Lastly, researchers
who fail to account for hierarchical (grouping) structures can reduce
the precision of model parameter estimates, which may amplify the
overestimation of reliability \citep[pp.~482]{Hoyle_et_al_2023}.
Together, these issues undermine the reliability of the trait and
compromise the validity of its estimates
\citep[pp.~2]{Perron_et_al_2015}.

\subsection{The disconnect between trait measurement and hypothesis
testing}\label{sec-theory-issue2}

Building on the previous section, it is clear that, despite its
limitations, the BTL model is commonly used as the measurement model in
CJ assessments. A measurement model specifies how manifest variables
contribute to the estimation of latent variables
\citep{Everitt_et_al_2010}. For example, when evaluating text quality,
researchers use the BTL model to process the dichotomous outcomes
resulting from the pairwise comparisons (the manifest variables) to
estimate scores that reflect the underlying quality level of the texts
(the latent variable)
\citep{Laming_2004, Pollitt_2012b, Whitehouse_2012, vanDaal_et_al_2016, Lesterhuis_2018_thesis, Coertjens_et_al_2017, Goossens_et_al_2018, Bouwer_et_al_2023}.

Researchers then typically use these estimated BTL scores, or their
transformations, to conduct additional analyses or hypothesis tests. For
example, these scores have been used to identify `misfit' judges and
stimuli \citep{Pollitt_2012b, vanDaal_et_al_2016, Goossens_et_al_2018},
detect biases in judges' ratings
\citep{Pollitt_et_al_2003, Pollitt_2012b}, calculate correlations with
other assessment methods \citep{Goossens_et_al_2018, Bouwer_et_al_2023},
or test hypotheses related to the underlying trait of interest
\citep{Bramley_et_al_2019, Boonen_et_al_2020, Bouwer_et_al_2023, vanDaal_et_al_2017, Jones_et_al_2019, Gijsen_et_al_2021}.

However, the statistical literature advises caution when using estimated
scores for additional analyses and tests. A key consideration is that
BTL scores are parameter estimates that inherently carry uncertainty.
Ignoring this uncertainty can bias the analysis and reduce the precision
of hypothesis tests. Notably, the direction and magnitude of such biases
are often unpredictable. Results may be attenuated, exaggerated, or
remain unaffected depending on the degree of uncertainty in the scores
and the actual effects being tested
\citetext{\citealp[pp.~25]{Kline_et_al_2023}; \citealp[pp.~137]{Hoyle_et_al_2023}}.
Finally, the reduced precision in hypothesis tests diminishes their
statistical power, increasing the likelihood of committing type-I or
type-II errors \citep{McElreath_2020}.
