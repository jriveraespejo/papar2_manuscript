A key consideration is that BTL scores are parameter estimates that inherently carry uncertainty. Ignoring this uncertainty when conducting separate analyses and tests can inflate their precision and statistical power, increasing the risk of committing a type I error \\[@McElreath_2020\\]. A type I error results when a null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected \\[@Everitt_et_al_2010\\]."

A structural model specify how different manifest or latent variables influence the latent variable of interest \\[@Everitt_et_al_2010\\]. This approach allows analyses that can account for both the scores and their uncertainties simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate elements.
