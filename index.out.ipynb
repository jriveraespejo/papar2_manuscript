    "In *comparative judgment* (CJ) studies, judges assess the presence of a trait or competence by conducting pairwise comparisons of stimuli ([Thurstone 1927](#ref-Thurstone_1927); [Pollitt 2004](#ref-Pollitt_2004), [2012a](#ref-Pollitt_2012a)). The comparison produces a dichotomous outcome, indicating which stimulus is perceived to possess a higher trait level. After conducting multiple rounds of pairwise comparisons, researchers use the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model ([Bradley and Terry 1952](#ref-Bradley_et_al_1952); [Luce 1959](#ref-Luce_1959)) to process the outcomes and estimate scores that reflect the underlying trait of interest. This method has been successfully employed in assessing the quality of written texts, where quality describes the underlying trait of interest and the texts serve as the stimuli ([Laming 2004](#ref-Laming_2004); [Pollitt 2012b](#ref-Pollitt_2012b); [Whitehouse 2012](#ref-Whitehouse_2012); [van Daal et al. 2016](#ref-vanDaal_et_al_2016); [Lesterhuis 2018](#ref-Lesterhuis_2018); [Coertjens et al. 2017](#ref-Coertjens_et_al_2017); [Goossens and De Maeyer 2018](#ref-Goossens_et_al_2018); [Bouwer et al. 2023](#ref-Bouwer_et_al_2023))."

    "Numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of CJ in assessing various traits and competencies over the past decade. These studies have emphasized three aspects of the method’s effectiveness: its reliability, validity, and practical applicability. Research on reliability indicates that CJ requires a relatively small number of pairwise comparisons ([S. Verhavert et al. 2019](#ref-Verhavert_et_al_2019); [Crompvoets, Béguin, and Sijtsma 2022](#ref-Crompvoets_et_al_2022)) to produce trait scores that are as precise and consistent as those generated by other assessment methods ([Coertjens et al. 2017](#ref-Coertjens_et_al_2017); [Goossens and De Maeyer 2018](#ref-Goossens_et_al_2018); [Bouwer et al. 2023](#ref-Bouwer_et_al_2023)). Furthermore, evidence suggests that the reliability and time efficiency of CJ are comparable, if not superior, to those of other assessment methods when employing adaptive comparison algorithms ([Pollitt 2012b](#ref-Pollitt_2012b); [San Verhavert, Furlong, and Bouwer 2022](#ref-Verhavert_et_al_2022); [Mikhailiuk et al. 2021](#ref-Mikhailiuk_et_al_2021)). Additionally, research on validity suggests that scores generated by CJ can accurately represent the traits under measurement ([Whitehouse 2012](#ref-Whitehouse_2012); [van Daal et al. 2016](#ref-vanDaal_et_al_2016); [Lesterhuis 2018](#ref-Lesterhuis_2018); [Bartholomew et al. 2018](#ref-Bartholomew_et_al_2018); [Bouwer et al. 2023](#ref-Bouwer_et_al_2023)). Finally, research on practical applicability highlights the method’s versatility across both educational and non-educational contexts ([Jones 2015](#ref-Jones_2015); [Bartholomew et al. 2018](#ref-Bartholomew_et_al_2018); [Jones et al. 2019](#ref-Jones_et_al_2019); [Marshall et al. 2020](#ref-Marshall_et_al_2020); [Bartholomew and Williams 2020](#ref-Bartholomew_et_al_2020); [Boonen, Kloots, and Gillis 2020](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2020))."

    "Nevertheless, despite the growing number of CJ studies, the literature’s unsystematic and fragmented research approaches have left several critical issues unaddressed. This research primarily focuses on three: the apparent disconnect between CJ’s measurement and structural model, the over-reliance on the assumptions of Thurstone’s Case 5 ([1927](#ref-Thurstone_1927)) in CJ’s measurement model, and the unclear role of comparison algorithms on the method’s reliability and validity. The following sections will discuss each of these issues in detail, followed by the introduction of a theoretical model and its statistical translation, which aims to address all three concerns simultaneously.\n",

    "In a typical CJ study, the BTL model serves as the measurement model for CJ ([Andrich 1978](#ref-Andrich_1978); [Bramley 2008](#ref-Bramley_2008)). A measurement model specifies how manifest variables contribute to the estimation of latent variables ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). For example, when evaluating text quality, the BTL model uses the dichotomous outcomes resulting from the pairwise comparisons (the manifest variables) to estimate scores that reflect the underlying quality level of the texts (the latent variable) ([Laming 2004](#ref-Laming_2004); [Pollitt 2012b](#ref-Pollitt_2012b); [Whitehouse 2012](#ref-Whitehouse_2012); [van Daal et al. 2016](#ref-vanDaal_et_al_2016); [Lesterhuis 2018](#ref-Lesterhuis_2018); [Coertjens et al. 2017](#ref-Coertjens_et_al_2017); [Goossens and De Maeyer 2018](#ref-Goossens_et_al_2018); [Bouwer et al. 2023](#ref-Bouwer_et_al_2023))."

A structural model specify how different manifest or latent variables influence the latent variable of interest ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). This approach allows analyses that can account for both the scores and their uncertainties simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate elements.
