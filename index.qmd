  Dichotomous Comparative Judgment [DCJ, @Pollitt_2012a, @Pollitt_2012b] requires judges to evaluate the relative manifestation of traits between pairs of stimuli, resulting in a dichotomous outcome indicating which stimulus exhibits the trait more strongly. Research has demonstrated DCJ's effectiveness and reliability in various domains [@Pollitt_2012b; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018; @Bartholomew_et_al_2020; @Boonen_et_al_2020]. Nevertheless, despite the method's widespread use, the literature lacks a transparent depiction of the DCJ system and the plausible mechanisms that generate the DCJ data. Particularly, there is no detailed explanation of how different assessment factors can potentially influence the observed DCJ data. This study aims to fill this gap by applying the framework of causal analysis and Directed Acyclic Graphs [DAG; @Pearl_2009]. Using this framework, the study will construct a scientific model to elucidate the causal assumptions and mechanisms inherent the system. This model will enable researchers to draw inferences about causal relationships from DCJ data. Subsequently, the study will translate this model into a probabilistic statistical model, aiming to derive statistical estimands for different targets of inference. The outcomes of this study will inform the planning of DCJ experiments and hold significance for researchers or analysts involved in education and assessment procedures who implement the DCJ methodology.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

<!-- 1. What is comparative judgment? -->
In contemporary contexts, Thurstone's law of comparative judgment [-@Thurstone_1927] primarily refers to the method of *Dichotomous* Comparative Judgment [DCJ, @Pollitt_2012a; @Pollitt_2012b]. In DCJ, a judge assesses the relative manifestation of a *trait* within a pair of stimuli. This assessment results in a dichotomous value indicating which stimulus possesses a higher degree of the trait. After different judges perform multiple rounds of pairwise comparisons, an outcome vector is produced. This vector is modeled using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model [BTL, @Bradley_et_al_1952; @Luce_1959], which creates a score that corresponds with the trait of interest. This score is then used to rank the stimuli from lowest to highest or to evaluate the influence of certain variables on the stimuli's positions in the ranking.

<!-- 2. in what has been applied on?, and where is the gap? -->
DCJ has proven effective in assessing competencies and traits predominantly within the educational realm, as demonstrated by @Pollitt_2012b, @Jones_2015, @vanDaal_et_al_2016, @Bartholomew_et_al_2018, @Lesterhuis_2018, @Bartholomew_et_al_2020, and @Marshall_et_al_2020. However, its application transcends education, as exemplified by @Boonen_et_al_2020. The methodology has also evolved to include multiple, as opposed to pairwise comparisons [@Luce_1959; @Placket_1975], and to accommodate comparisons with ordinal outcomes [@Tutz_1986; @Agresti_1992]. Overall, research suggests that DCJ offers an alternative and efficient approach to measurement and evaluation, characterized by its reliability and validity [@Lesterhuis_2018; @vanDaal_2020; @Marshall_et_al_2020]. Nevertheless, despite the method's widespread use, the literature does not offer a clear representation of the plausible mechanisms that generate the DCJ data. Particularly, there is no depiction of the complexity and the underlying assumptions of the DCJ system, nor how different assessment factors can potentially influence the observed DCJ outcome.

<!-- 3. What are the factors behind DCJ? -->
According to @Verhavert_et_al_2019 and @vanDaal_2020, several assessment factors interact and influence the DCJ outcome. These factors include the number and characteristics of the stimuli, their *proximity* in terms of the assessed trait, the number of comparison per stimulus, and the pairing algorithm used. Furthermore, since the method relies on judges' assessments, the number and characteristics of judges, their *discrimination* abilities, and the number of comparisons per judge also play pivotal roles. Moreover, when the stimuli represent sub-units of higher-levels units, factors such as the number and characteristics of these units, along with their *proximity* in terms of the assessed trait, can significantly influence the outcome. For instance, @vanDaal_et_al_2016 assessed university students' skills in academic writing, utilizing multiple argumentative essays (stimuli, sub-units) originating from various students (units). 

<!-- 4. Solution to the gap, final objective and relevance -->
Although several studies have examined the individual impact of these factors on the method's reliability [@Bramley_2015; @Pollitt_2012b; @Bramley_et_al_2019; @Verhavert_et_al_2019; @Crompvoets_et_al_2022; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @Gijsen_et_al_2021], none, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have provided a transparent depiction of the DCJ system and the plausible mechanisms generating the DCJ outcome. This study aims to fill this gap by representing DCJ within the causal analysis framework [@Pearl_2009; @Pearl_et_al_2016]. Using Directed Acyclic Graphs [DAG, @Gross_et_al_2018; @Neal_2020], the study will construct a scientific model to elucidate the underlying assumptions of the DCJ system, providing plausible mechanisms for how the DCJ outcome could be generated. Next, using a minimal set of assumptions embedded in the framework, the study will translate the scientific model into a probabilistic statistical model. This model derives statistical estimands to draw inferences about plausible causal relationships within the DCJ system. Ultimately, this research aims to extend the law of comparative judgment initially proposed by @Thurstone_1927 and provide a sound probabilistic base for the statistical analysis of DCJ data. Consequently, this research holds significance for researchers and analysts involved in education and assessment procedures who implement or design DCJ experiments.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  O_{kijr_{ij}} := & \; f_{O}( \delta_{kijr_{ij}} ) \\
  \delta_{kijr_{ij}} := & \; f_{D}( \gamma_{k}, \theta_{ir_{i}} ) \\
  \gamma_{k} := & \; f_{G}( Z_{k}, e_{k} ) \\
  \theta_{ir_{i}} := & \; f_{R}( \theta_{i}, Y_{r}, e_{r_{i}} ) \\
  \theta_{i} := & \; f_{T}( X_{i}, e_{i} ) \\
  & \; e_{k} \dsep e_{i} \\
  & \; e_{k} \dsep e_{r_{i}} \\
  & \; e_{i} \dsep e_{r_{i}}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-StructuralModel}



## From the scientific to statistical model {#sec-theory-statistics}

$$
\begin{aligned}
  O_{kijr_{ij}} \sim & \; \text{Bernoulli}\left[ \; logit^{-1}\left( \delta_{kijr_{ij}} \right) \; \right] \\
  \delta_{kijr_{ij}} = & \; \gamma_{k}( \theta_{ir_{i}} - \theta_{jr_{j}} ) \\
  \gamma_{k} = & \; logit^{-1}\left[ \beta_{Z} Z_{k} + e_{k} \right] \\
  \theta_{ir_{i}} = & \; \theta_{i} + \beta_{Y} Y_{r} + e_{r_{i}}  \\
  \theta_{i} = & \; \beta_{X} X_{i} + e_{i}  \\
  e_{k} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{k(g)}) \\
  e_{i} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{i(g)}) \\
  e_{r_{i}} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{r(g)})
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-StatModel_general}

for identification purposes we can set $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{k(g)} = 0.02$, $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{i(g)} = 1$, and $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{r(g)} = 1$. A special case of this would be to assume that the data comes from the same population, in that case, $\sigma_{k(g)} = \sigma_{k} = 0.02$, $\sigma_{i(g)} = \sigma_{i} = 1$



## Let's talk about Thurstone {#sec-theory-thurstone}


Thurstone's comparative judgment @Thurstone_1927 is based on the formula:
$$
X_{AB} = \frac{S_{A} - S_{B}}{\sigma_{AB}}
$$

where $X_{AB}$ defines the comparative judgment outcome, $S_{A}$ and $S_{B}$ are the modal discriminal processes, $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B} + 2 \rho \sigma_{A} \sigma_{B}}$, with $\sigma_{A}$ and $\sigma_{B}$ being the dispersion of discriminal processes $A$ and $B$, respectively, and $\rho$ the correlation between discriminal processes.   

The theory identifies five cases:

- **Case 1:** only constant $\rho$ (not $\rho_{ij}$)
- **Case 2:** $X_{ij}$ becomes $X_{kij}$ with $k=1, \dots, K$ judges (replication, not duplication)
- **Case 3:** $\rho = 0$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B}}$ 
- **Case 4:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}+d$, then $\lim_{d \leq 0.1\sigma_{A}} \sigma_{AB} = (\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) /\sqrt{2}$
- **Case 5:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{2}\sigma$

Now using the DAG and statistical notation

$$
\begin{aligned}
  O_{kijr_{ij}} := & \; f_{O}( \delta_{kijr_{ij}} ) \\
  \delta_{kijr_{ij}} = & \; \gamma_{k}( \theta_{ir_{i}} - \theta_{jr_{j}} ) \\
  \gamma_{k} = & \; f_{G}( Z_{k}, e_{k} ) \\
  \theta_{ir_{i}} = & \; \theta_{i} + \beta_{Y} Y_{r} + e_{r_{i}}  \\
  \theta_{i} = & \; \beta_{X} X_{i} + e_{i}  \\
  e_{k} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{k(g)}) \\
  e_{i} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{i(g)}) \\
  e_{r_{i}} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{r(g)})
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-StatModel_thurstone}

The theory identifies five cases:

- **Case 1:** only constant $\rho \approx \sigma_{i}$
- **Case 2:** now judges are separated by using $\gamma_{k}$
- **Case 3:** $\rho \approx \sigma_{e_{i}} = 0$ (no nesting of texts on students), then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B}}$ 
- **Case 4:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}+d$, then $\lim_{d \leq 0.1\sigma_{A}} \sigma_{AB} = (\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) /\sqrt{2}$
- **Case 5:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{2}\sigma$

But now can we see other scenarios than just those 5 cases?

- consider different $\rho \approx \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sigma_{p}$, depending on $P$ nesting structures 
- we can now investigate $\gamma_{k}$
- we can assume $\sigma_{B} \neq \sigma_{A}$, no need for results on the limit
