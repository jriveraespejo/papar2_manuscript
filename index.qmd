  Dichotomous Comparative Judgment (DCJ, @Pollitt_2012a, @Pollitt_2012b) requires judges to evaluate the relative manifestation of traits between pairs of stimuli, resulting in a dichotomous outcome indicating which stimulus exhibits the trait more strongly. Research has demonstrated DCJ's effectiveness and reliability in various domains [@Pollitt_2012b; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018; @Bartholomew_et_al_2020; @Boonen_et_al_2020]. However, the literature lacks a clear and transparent depiction of the plausible mechanisms underlying DCJ data. Specifically, there is no detail explanation of how the different assessment factors can potentially influence the observed DCJ data. This study aims to fill this gap by applying the framework of causal analysis and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG; @Pearl_2009). Using this framework, the study will construct a scientific model to elucidate the causal assumptions and mechanisms inherent the system. This model will enable researchers to draw inferences about causal relationships from DCJ data. Subsequently, the study will translate this model into a probabilistic statistical model, aiming to derive statistical estimands for different targets of inference. The outcomes of this study will inform the planning of DCJ experiments and hold significance for researchers or analysts involved in education and assessment procedures who implement the DCJ methodology.
