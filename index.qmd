<!-- Part 2; 00:14:30 - 00:21:00 -->

<!-- 1. Where are we now with DCJ? -->

<!-- Notes: -->
<!-- - In the past decade there has been a growing number of studies that document and analyze the merits of DCJ as an assessment tool. Define a bit DCJ. -->
<!-- - It has been a growing field, where people has tested some important aspects of the method. In general, is an iterative process. People are iterating on particular aspects of the method, such as: -->
<!-- a. issues within the method as such, critical analyze some aspect of the method -->
<!-- b. practical use of the method, generate scores with the BTL, and use this scores with some hypotheses, or descriptions. -->

Over the past decade, numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of the *comparative judgment* (CJ) method [@Thurstone_1927] for assessing competencies and traits. These studies have evaluated CJ from two main perspectives: its ability to produce reliable and valid trait scores, and its practical applicability. Research on reliability and validity has shown that CJ can generate precise and consistent scores [@Pollitt_2012a; @Pollitt_2012b; @Bramley_et_al_2019; @Verhavert_et_al_2019; @Crompvoets_et_al_2022; @Bouwer_et_al_2023] that accurately represent the traits being measured [@Whitehouse_2012; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018]. Regarding practical applicability, several studies have highlighted CJ's versatility across both educational and non-educational contexts, presenting it as an efficient and effective alternative for measurement and evaluation [@Jones_2015; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @Jones_et_al_2019; @Marshall_et_al_2020; @Bartholomew_et_al_2020; @Boonen_et_al_2020].

<!-- 2. But what are the problems of DCJ as a method? -->

<!-- Notes:  -->
<!-- - But what it is the problem with this way of using DCJ (just one paragraph) -->
<!-- a. measurement model is based on case V -->
<!--   a.1 It does not consider the effects of judges (different perceptions per stimuli) -->
<!--   a.2 It does not consider that stimuli may be nested in individuals -->
<!-- b. in all literature there is a disconnection between measurement model and the structural part (common practical use) -->
<!-- c. what about the experimental design?, what are the implications of certain comparison algorithms? -->

Nevertheless, despite the growing number of CJ studies, the unsystematic and fragmented research approaches employed in the literature have overlooked several critical issues concerning the method. These issues fall into three main categories: concerns about the structural model, the measurement model, and the experimental design of CJ. In the following sections, each issue will be discussed in detail, followed by the introduction of an approach that addresses all three concerns simultaneously.

## The disconect between structural and measurement model

<!-- Structural model -->

<!-- Regarding this, it is apparent that in all literature there is a disconnection between measurement model and the structural part, where hypothesis and summaries are performed. -->

<!-- The current literature estimates the CJ scores to later used them into other analysis, such as investigating bias and misfits among judges, or for the comparison of groups of individuals. This ignores measurement error. -->


A key issue in the first category is the apparent disconnect between the method's structural and measurement models. In CJ literature, it is common to perform data analysis and hypothesis testing on scores estimated using the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [@Bradley_et_al_1952; @Luce_1959]. Several studies use the scores generated by the BTL model or their transformations to identify 'misfit' judges and stimuli [@Pollitt_2012b; @vanDaal_et_al_2017], detect 'bias' in judges' ratings [@Pollitt_et_al_2003; @Pollitt_2012b], or test various hypotheses about the underlying trait being measured [@Bramley_et_al_2019; @Boonen_et_al_2020; @Bouwer_et_al_2023; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @Jones_et_al_2019; @Gijsen_et_al_2021]. In the motivating example, ...

However, since these scores are parameter estimates with inherent uncertainty, the statistical literature suggests that separating the analysis from this uncertainty may artificially inflate the precision and power of the results. This, in turn, could increase the risk of committing a type I error, where a null hypothesis is wrongly rejected [@McElreath_2020]. In the motivating example

To address this issue properly, the approach should follow a strategy similar to that used in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), where data analysis and hypothesis testing occur at the structural model level, while the BTL model functions as the measurement model.



<!-- Measurement model -->

<!-- @Thurstone_1927 justify the use of case V, on multiple assumptions, but the most important for our purpose are three:  -->

<!-- (a) related to Case 3, it assumes the correlation between stimuli is zero, this translates into the cancellation of judges effects by mean of opposing and equally weigthed 'mood' and 'simultaneous contrasts' effects. This is demonstrated using the additivive nature of the logit scale, which helps to cancel 'bias' judges effects. -->
<!-- This is the case of confounding, and @Andrich_1978 already showed that if judges effects are parametrized, it gets eliminated experimentally in the paired comparison method.  -->

<!-- possibility of bias is hinted in @Bramley_2008, and later mentioned again in @Kelly_et_al_2022, and some evidence is found in @Pollitt_et_al_2003, @Arlett_2003, @Guthrie_2003, @vanDaal_et_al_2017 and @Gijsen_et_al_2021 -->

<!-- Reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity. Reliability can exist without validity but validity cannot exist without reliability [@Perron_et_al_2015]. -->


<!-- (b) related to Case 3, it assumes the correlation between stimuli is zero, this also translates into the idea that stimuli are the main focus of estimation and analysis, but what happens when the focus of analysis is the individuals that generated those stimuli. There is an amount of correlation that it is not accounted for.  -->
<!-- This is the case of clustering or measurement error, and overlooking issues such as clustering and measurement error can lead to biased and less precise parameter estimates [@McElreath_2020], ultimately diminishing the statistical power of models and increasing the likelihood of committing type I or type II errors when addressing research inquiries.  -->

<!-- This has been considered in the literature as a (see https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X15571817) or a multilevel BTL model (find sources) -->

<!-- (c) related to case 5, discriminal dispersions of the stimuli are equal, but it is not hard to imagine that certain individuals can produce good quality texts with more precision than other individuals.  -->

<!-- This ties up with the next subject -->




<!-- Moreover, a notable concern in the second category is the measurement model's reliance on the assumptions of Case 5 from Thurstone's law of comparative judgment [-@Thurstone_1927]. As noted, it is common practice in the literature to use the BTL model as a means of generating CJ scores, serving as the measurement model. -->

<!-- Since the study by @Bramley_2008, it has been clear that the BTL model represents a statistical articulation of Case 5. -->

<!-- Although Case 5 was originally articulated to produce a "rather coarse scaling" of traits [@Thurstone_1927, p. 269], its assumptions have become predominant in the literature due to its implementation through the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [@Bradley_et_al_1952; @Luce_1959]. This leaves issues such as the presence of judge' biases hinted by @Bramley_2008 and @Kelly_et_al_2022, and evidenced by @Pollitt_et_al_2003, @Arlett_2003, and @Guthrie_2003 -->




<!-- Experimental design -->

<!-- In this regard, although the literature has tested multiple features of the experimental design of the method, such as the comparison algorithm and the number of comparisons, it is not clear where this procedures fit in the whole process of comparison, and what are their implications for the outcome of the method. -->

<!-- present the evidence of bias effects of adaptive algorithms, the not clear view of how many comparisons per (sub)units are required. Adhoc rules of thumb. -->


<!-- and issues related to the method's experimental design. These issues can affect the method's reliability, validity, and practical applicability. -->



<!-- 3. What is the solution? -->

<!-- Notes:  -->
<!-- - There is some gain on considering a more integrated overarching systematic way of looking on what happen in DCJ when people compare two stimuli -->
<!-- - This paper tries to systematically integrate all aspects at play in a single scientific model, we will build the model in a stepwise manner using -->
<!-- - we will build a scientific model (more theoretical model) that integrates different aspects of the method that are at play when people use DCJ. -->
