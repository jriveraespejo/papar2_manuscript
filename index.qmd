# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

<!-- recording -->
<!-- Part 1; 00:00:00 - 00:09:10 -->
<!-- Part 2; 00:14:30 - 00:21:00 -->

<!-- 1. Where are we now with DCJ? -->

<!-- Notes: -->
<!-- - In the past decade there has been a growing number of studies that document and analyze the merits of DCJ as an assessment tool. Define a bit DCJ. -->
<!-- - It has been a growing field, where people has tested some important aspects of the method. In general, is an iterative process. People are iterating on particular aspects of the method, such as: -->
<!-- a. issues within the method as such, critical analyze some aspect of the method -->
<!-- b. practical use of the method, generate scores with the BTL, and use this scores with some hypotheses, or descriptions. -->

Over the past decade, numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of the *comparative judgment* (CJ) method [@Thurstone_1927; @Pollitt_2012a] for assessing competencies and traits. These studies have examined the method's strengths from two main perspectives: its capacity to produce reliable and valid trait scores, and its practical applicability. In terms of reliability and validity, research indicates that CJ generates precise and consistent scores that accurately represent the traits being measured. Key contributions in this area include those by @Bramley_2008, @Pollitt_2012b, @Whitehouse_2012, @Lesterhuis_2018, @vanDaal_et_al_2019, @Bramley_et_al_2019, @Verhavert_et_al_2019, @Crompvoets_et_al_2022, and @Bouwer_et_al_2023. Regarding practical applicability, several studies have demonstrated the method's versatility in both educational and non-educational settings, offering an efficient and effective alternative for measurement and evaluation. Notable examples include the works of @Jones_2015, @Bartholomew_et_al_2018, @Jones_et_al_2019, @Marshall_et_al_2020, @Bartholomew_et_al_2020, and @Boonen_et_al_2020.


<!-- 2. But what are the problems of DCJ as a method? -->

<!-- Notes:  -->
<!-- - But what it is the problem with this way of using DCJ (just one paragraph) -->
<!-- a. measurement model is based on case V -->
<!--   a.1 It does not consider the effects of judges (different perceptions per stimuli) -->
<!--   a.2 It does not consider that stimuli may be nested in individuals -->
<!-- b. in all literature there is a disconnection between measurement model and the structural part (common practical use) -->
<!-- c. what about the experimental design?, what are the implications of certain comparison algorithms? -->



<!-- 3. What is the solution? -->

<!-- Notes:  -->
<!-- - There is some gain on considering a more integrated overarching systematic way of looking on what happen in DCJ when people compare two stimuli -->
<!-- - This paper tries to systematically integrate all aspects at play in a single scientific model, we will build the model in a stepwise manner using -->
<!-- - we will build a scientific model (more theoretical model) that integrates different aspects of the method that are at play when people use DCJ. -->
