<!-- 1. Overview of CJ method in assessing traits -->
In *comparative judgment* (CJ) studies, judges assess a specific trait or attribute across various stimuli by performing pairwise comparisons [@Thurstone_1927a; @Thurstone_1927b]. Each comparison produces a dichotomous outcome, indicating which stimulus is perceived to exhibit a higher trait level. For example, when assessing text quality, judges compare pairs of written texts (the stimuli) to determine the relative quality each text exhibit (the trait) [@Laming_2004; @Pollitt_2012b; @Whitehouse_2012; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018_thesis; @Coertjens_et_al_2017; @Goossens_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023].

<!-- and spoken language [@Boonen_et_al_2020]. Additionally, it has been applied to evaluate various competencies, including mathematical problem-solving skills [@Jones_et_al_2015], engineering design skills [@Bartholomew_et_al_2018], build real-time web-based portfolios of performance [@@Kimbell_2012], conceptual understanding in algebra [@Jones_et_al_2019], statistical and English knowledge [@Marshall_et_al_2020], and STEM knowledge and skills [@Bartholomew_et_al_2020]. -->

<!-- 2. What is the effectiveness of CJ -->
Numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of CJ in assessing traits and competencies over the past decade. These studies have emphasized three aspects of the method's effectiveness: its reliability, validity, and practical applicability. Research on reliability indicates that CJ requires a relatively small number of pairwise comparisons [@Verhavert_et_al_2019; @Crompvoets_et_al_2022] to produce trait scores that are as precise and consistent as those generated by other assessment methods [@Coertjens_et_al_2017; @Goossens_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the reliability and time efficiency of CJ are comparable, if not superior, to those of other assessment methods when employing adaptive comparison algorithms [@Pollitt_2012b; @Verhavert_et_al_2022; @Mikhailiuk_et_al_2021]. On the other hand, research on validity suggests that scores generated by CJ can accurately represent the traits under measurement [@Whitehouse_2012; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018_thesis; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023]. Finally, research on practical applicability highlights the method's versatility across both educational and non-educational contexts [@Kimbell_2012; @Jones_et_al_2015; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @Jones_et_al_2019; @Marshall_et_al_2020; @Bartholomew_et_al_2020; @Boonen_et_al_2020].

<!-- 3. But what critical issues remain CJ Research -->
Nevertheless, despite the increasing number of CJ studies, unsystematic and fragmented research approaches have left several critical issues unaddressed. This research primarily focuses on three: the over-reliance on Thurstone's Case V assumptions in the statistical analysis of CJ data, the apparent disconnect between CJ's trait measurement and hypothesis testing, and the unclear role of comparison algorithms on the method's reliability and validity. The following sections will discuss each of these issues in detail, followed by the introduction of a theoretical model and its statistical translation, which aims to address all three concerns simultaneously.


# Three critical issues in CJ literature {#sec-theory-issues}

<!-- 1. Thurstone's Theory of CJ: discriminal process -->
In its most general form, Thurstone's theory [-@Thurstone_1927b] posits that the dichotomous outcome resulting from comparing two stimuli is determined by two factors: the discriminal process of each stimulus and their discriminal difference. The *discriminal process* refers to the psychological effect each stimulus has on the judges, or more simply stated, the judges’ perception of the trait level of each stimulus. Thurstone assumes that the discriminal process for each stimulus follows a Normal distribution. In this distribution, the mode (mean), known as the *modal discriminal process*, represents the position of the stimulus on the trait continuum, while the dispersion, known as the *discriminal dispersion*, reflects the variability in the stimulus' perceived trait level. @fig-discriminal_process shows example distributions of discriminal process for two stimuli (objects). 

![Example distributions of discriminal processes for two stimuli (objects). Extracted from @Bramley_2008 [pp. 249]. ](/images/figures/discriminal_process.png){#fig-discriminal_process width=70%}

<!-- 2. Thurstone's Theory of CJ: discriminal difference -->
However, since the discriminal mode and dispersion of a single stimulus are not directly observable except through comparison, the *law of comparative judgment* becomes essential. This law asserts that when assessing a specific trait by comparing two stimuli, the stimulus positioned further along the continuum is perceived as having a higher level of that trait. Thus, the observed dichotomous outcome is determined by the distribution of the difference between the stimuli's discriminal processes, called the *discriminal difference*. @fig-comparative_judgment shows an example distribution of the discriminal difference for two stimuli (objects).

![Distribution of the discriminal difference between two stimuli (objects). Extracted from @Bramley_2008 [pp. 251]. ](/images/figures/comparative_judgment.png){#fig-comparative_judgment width=65%}

<!-- 3. Thurstone's Cases and their simplifying assumptions  -->
Importantly, the theory's general form primarily addresses pairwise comparisons of stimuli made by a single judge [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 267]. Consequently, to enhance its practical applicability, Thurstone introduced five distinct cases, each defined by progressively simplifying assumptions. @tbl-thurstone_cases summarizes these cases, focusing on key assumptions such as the distribution of discriminal processes, the similarity of discriminal dispersions across stimuli, the correlation between stimuli, and which judges perform the comparisons. For a comprehensive discussion of this progression, refer to @Thurstone_1927b and @Bramley_2008 [pp. 248-253].

## The Case V and the statistical analysis of CJ data

<!-- recording: Sven and Tine 24.10.25; time: 00:31:10 - 00:52:20 -->
<!-- recording: Sven and Tine 24.11.12; time: 00:00:00 - 00:00:00 -->

<!-- 1. The Case V and its simpler statistical representation: the BTL model -->
Surprisingly, despite its reliance on the largest number of simplifying assumptions [@Bramley_2008, pp. 253; @Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 677], Case V remains the most widely used case in the CJ literature. This popularity is largely due to its simplified statistical representation in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [@Bradley_et_al_1952; @Luce_1959]. The BTL model mirrors Case V’s assumptions, with one key difference: while Case V assumes a Normal distribution for the stimuli's discriminal processes, the BTL model uses the more mathematically tractable Logistic distribution [@Andrich_1978; @Bramley_2008, pp. 254] (see @tbl-thurstone_cases). This substitution has little effect on the model's estimation or interpretation, as the Normal and Logistic distributions differ by a scaling factor of approximately $1.7$ [@vanderLinden_et_al_2017_I, pp. 16] (refer to @fig-logistic_vs_normal).

<!-- 2. But what are limitations of Case V (and the BTL model) -->
However, Case V was originally developed to provide a "rather coarse scaling" of traits [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 269], prioritizing statistical simplicity over precision in trait measurement [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 677]. As a result, its assumptions may not suit applications beyond the psycho-physical contexts for which it was created. Thurstone himself cautioned that its use "should not be made without experimental test" [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 270], acknowledging that some assumptions could prove problematic with complex traits or less homogeneous stimuli [@Thurstone_1927a, pp. 374]. Consequently, given that current CJ applications often deal these types of traits and stimuli, two key assumptions of Case V may not consistently hold in theory or practice: the zero correlation and equal dispersion between stimuli. 

<!-- Adding assumptions simplifies the formula and improves its tractability, but one cannot place as much confidence in the outputs of the formula if those assumptions are not met [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 677]. -->

<!-- 3. What does the zero correlation between stimuli imply? -->
The assumption of *zero correlation between stimuli* is best illustrated with an example. For instance, when evaluating text quality, the assumption suggests that a judge’s perception of quality in one text does not influence the perception of the same trait in the comparison text. Thurstone attributes this independence to the cancellation of potential judges' biases, driven by opposing and equally weighted factors that operate during pairwise comparisons, called 'mood' and 'simultaneous contrast' effects [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 268]. This cancellation of bias has been mathematically demonstrated by @Andrich_1978, assuming discriminal processes with additive biases and a logit scale derived from the BTL model.

<!-- 4. But what are the problems of assuming zero correlation? -->
However, two types of scenarios make it plausible that potential judges' biases may not cancel: those involving complex traits and less homogeneous stimuli, and those where judges differ in what they value in their assessments. In the first scenario, Thurstone noted that for complex traits and non-homogeneous stimuli, such as handwriting or English compositions, CJ data might not align with the assumptions of Case V [@Thurstone_1927a, pp. 374]. This insight likely extends to other similarly complex traits and stimuli. In the second scenario, evidence indicates that judges' assessments are influenced by multiple, intricate aspects of the stimuli [@vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018; @Chambers_et_al_2022]. Moreover, factors like age, culture, education, expertise [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 683], and even individual differences among judges [@Gill_et_al_2013; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @vanDaal_2020] can influence judgment accuracy. These scenarios can ultimately result in non-additive biases that resist cancellation, driven by the characteristics or location of stimuli within the trait continuum.

<!-- seen as a strength of the method [@vanDaal_et_al_2016], and commonly referred to as "the wisdom of crowds" [@Surowiecki_2004] -->

<!-- This means that the cancellation of judges' biases may not hold in theory or practice, and that judges' biases may depend on the stimuli, by means of an interaction (but present) or because the judges works as a confounder -->

<!-- Would the aggregate view of young, British-Asian men always be the same as the aggregate view of older, black women? [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 683] -->


<!-- 5. But there is another problem associated with the zero correlation that no one is talking -->
[This also translates into the idea that stimuli are the main focus of estimation and analysis, but what happens when the focus of analysis is the individuals that generated those stimuli. Meaning there is an amount of correlation that it is not accounted for. Use example of Boonen!! ]{style="color:red;"}

<!--   Here we loose precision, because we are not controlling for clustering -->

<!-- This is the case of clustering or measurement error, and overlooking issues such as clustering and measurement error can lead to biased and less precise parameter estimates [@McElreath_2020], ultimately diminishing the statistical power of models and increasing the likelihood of committing type I or type II errors when addressing research inquiries. -->

<!-- This has been considered in the literature as a (see https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X15571817) or a multilevel BTL model (find sources) -->


<!-- "It is a safe assumption that when the stimulus series is very homogeneous with no distracting attributes, the correlation between discriminal deviations is low and possible even zero" [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 268]. -->



Such differences may not be detected through analyses of bias and misfit [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 683]. 

<!-- Such differences may not be detected through analyses of bias and misfit. McMahon and Jones (2015) found differences between students and teachers in what was valued in assessments of understanding of a chemistry experiment. Where students prioritised factual recall, teachers prioritised scientific explanation. Both groups produced highly reliable scales (reliability estimates of .893 for students, and .874 for teachers). Although, in this case, a clear argument as to whose consensus should take priority can be made, it demonstrates the existence of different, but equally reliable, sets of consensuses depending on who is asked. [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 683] -->
<!-- What we are saying is that the judges' effects depend on the stimuli, by means of an interaction (but present) or because the judges works as a confounder. This, in the best scenario, cause less precise estimates, and in the worst scenario, biased estimates. possibility of bias is hinted in @Bramley_2008, and later mentioned again in @Kelly_et_al_2022, and some evidence is found in @Pollitt_et_al_2003, @vanDaal_et_al_2017 and @Gijsen_et_al_2021 -->

<!-- @Pollitt_et_al_2003 In Thurstone’s method each judge’s standard cancels out when a comparison is made, and any misfit between data and model must indicate a difference of some other kind. This is studied by analyzing the residuals that remain after the model is fitted to the data. Whenever one script is judged to have a higher value than a competing one it is expected to ‘win’ the comparison: if it does the residual will be small, but if it loses then the residual for that judge’s comparison of those two scripts will be large. Any patterns of large residuals will indicate some sort of bias – in this context bias simply means a source of systematic, rather than random, variability. indicates that one judge – Judge 5 – is significantly biased in some way. (Consider the problem of using adhoc methods) -->




<!-- 4. The problems of assuming equal dispersion between stimuli -->

<!-- it is not hard to imagine that certain individuals can produce good quality texts with more precision than other individuals. Example of exaggerated comparison of individuals, university students vs secondary school students. -->

<!--   here we face misspecification in the model -->

<!-- "It is probably true that this variability of the discriminal dispersion on the psychological continuum is of relatively less serious importance in dealing with strictly homogeneous stimulus series, but it becomes a serious factor in dealing with less conspicuous attributes or with less homogeneous stimulus series such as handwriting specimens, English compositions, sewing samples, oriental rugs." [@Thurstone_1927a, pp. 374]. -->


<!-- If your scores are not reliable they cannot be valid. People have been employing a model with assumptions that they do not know if those assumptions apply for their cases. And when you do that, the scores you produce most likely will not be reliable, which, in turn, renders them invalid. -->

<!-- Reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity. Reliability can exist without validity but validity cannot exist without reliability [@Perron_et_al_2015, pp. 2] -->

<!-- Of these, the most questionable is the one that the discriminal dispersions of all the objects are equal. Thurstone clearly did not expect this to hold for any but the most simple stimuli. The scripts used in cross-moderation exercises are obviously far more complex than any used by Thurstone, so it seems naïve to expect this assumption to hold here [@Bramley_2008]. -->




<!-- Moreover, a solution was already envisioned, @Andrich_1978 and @Wainer_et_al_1978 already showed that if judges effects are parametrized, it gets eliminated experimentally in the paired comparison method.  -->





## The disconnect between trait measurement and hypothesis testing

<!-- recording: Sven 24.10.04; time: 00:14:30 - 00:21:00 -->
<!-- recording: Sven and Tine 24.10.18; time: 00:08:30 - 00:14:55 -->
<!-- recording: Sven and Tine 24.10.25; time: 00:17:00 - 00:31:10 -->

<!-- 1. The BTL model as a measurement model for estimating latent traits -->
Building on the previous section, it is evident that the BTL model commonly functions as the measurement model for the trait of interest in CJ experiments [@Andrich_1978; @Bramley_2008]. A measurement model specifies how manifest variables contribute to the estimation of latent variables [@Everitt_et_al_2010]. For example, when evaluating text quality, researchers use the BTL model to process the dichotomous outcomes resulting from the pairwise comparisons (the manifest variables) to estimate scores that reflect the underlying quality level of texts (the latent variable) [@Laming_2004; @Pollitt_2012b; @Whitehouse_2012; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018_thesis; @Coertjens_et_al_2017; @Goossens_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023]. 

<!-- 2. Utilizing BTL Scores for further analysis and hypothesis testing -->
Researchers then typically use the estimated BTL scores, or their transformations, to conduct additional analyses or hypothesis tests. For example, these scores have been used to identify 'misfit' judges and stimuli [@Pollitt_2012b; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @Goossens_et_al_2018], detect biases in judges' ratings [@Pollitt_et_al_2003; @Pollitt_2012b], calculate correlations with other assessment methods [@Goossens_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023], or test hypotheses related to the underlying trait of interest [@Bramley_et_al_2019; @Boonen_et_al_2020; @Bouwer_et_al_2023; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @Jones_et_al_2019; @Gijsen_et_al_2021].

<!-- 3. But what are the challenges in using BTL scores for further analysis? -->
However, the statistical literature advises caution when using estimated scores to conduct additional analyses or hypotheses tests. A key consideration is that BTL scores are parameter estimates that inherently carry uncertainty. Ignoring this uncertainty can introduce bias into the analysis and reduce the precision of hypothesis tests. Notably, the direction and magnitude of the bias are often unpredictable; results may be attenuated, exaggerated, or remain unaffected, depending on the amount of uncertainty present in the scores and the actual effects being tested [@Kline_et_al_2023, pp. 25; @Hoyle_et_al_2023, pp. 137]. Furthermore, reduced precision in hypothesis tests weakens their statistical power, ultimately increasing the likelihood of committing type-I or type-II errors [@McElreath_2020]. 
<!-- A type-I error occurs when a *true* null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, while a type-II error occurs when a *false* null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted [@Everitt_et_al_2010]. -->

<!-- 4. So, how do we mitigate these risks?  -->
To mitigate these risks, principles from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) [@Hoyle_et_al_2023, pp. 138] and Item Response Theory (IRT) [@Fox_2010, chap. 6; @vanderLinden_et_al_2017_I, chap. 24] recommend conducting these analyses and tests within a structural model. A structural model specifies how different manifest or latent variables influence the latent variable of interest [@Everitt_et_al_2010]. This approach allows analyses that can account for both the BTL scores and their uncertainties simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate elements. Therefore, an integrated approach that combines CJ’s measurement and structural models can offer significant advantages.


## The role and impact of comparison algorithms

<!-- []{style="color:red;"} -->

<!-- Experimental design -->

<!-- In this regard, although the literature has tested multiple features of the experimental design of the method, such as the comparison algorithm and the number of comparisons, it is not clear where this procedures fit in the whole process of comparison, and what are their implications for the outcome of the method. -->

<!-- @Bramley_et_al_2019 and @Bramley_2015 says adaptivity inflates reliability. present the evidence of bias effects of adaptive algorithms, the not clear view of how many comparisons per (sub)units are required or how many judges should be involved [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 682]. Adhoc rules of thumb. -->

<!-- @Bramley_2015 -->
<!-- The implication is that the SSR statistic is worthless as an indicator of the quality / consistency / reliability of a scale constructed from an ACJ study that has involved a significant number of adaptive rounds. With random or fixed rounds, the SSR values were all below 0.25, which would generally be taken as an indicator of failure to create a meaningful scale. To put it another way, a low value of SSR almost certainly indicates low reliability, but a high value of SSR does not necessarily indicate high reliability.  -->
<!-- This is not to say that the ACJ studies listed in Table 1 (or indeed other studies not listed) were themselves worthless, just that not much should be made of claims about very high reliability in ACJ studies on the basis of high values of the SSR statistic. In fact, many of those studies also showed moderate to high correlations with variables external to the analysis, which were rightly interpreted as evidence of concurrent validity. -->
<!-- The conclusion is therefore that the SSR statistic is at best misleading and at worst worthless as an indicator of scale reliability whenever a CJ study has involved a significant amount of adaptivity. -->

<!-- @Gray_et_al_2024 entropy-driven active learning pair-selection algorithm to compare stimuli, vs random and no repeating pairs -->

<!-- @DeVrindt_et_al_2024 cold start problem to optimize time efficiency. -->

<!-- @Mikhailiuk_et_al_2021 proposed a fully Bayesian active sampling strategy for pairwise comparisons via Approximate Message Passing and Information Gain Maximization. ASAP computes the full posterior distribution, which is crucial to achieving accurate EIG estimates, and thus the accuracy of active sampling. We recommend ASAP, as it offered the highest accuracy of inferred scores compared to existing methods in experiments with real and synthetic data. -->

<!-- @Verhavert_et_al_2022 The current article proposes a new adaptive selection algorithm using a previously calibrated reference set. Using a reference set should eliminate the reliability inflation. It is proven that this adaptive selection algorithm is more efficient without reducing the accuracy of the results and without increasing the standard deviation of the assessment results.

<!-- and issues related to the method's experimental design. These issues can affect the method's reliability, validity, and practical applicability. -->


<!-- @Coertjens_et_al_2017 assess reliability and time investment. We conclude that pairwise comparison requires a similar time investment from evaluators as the criterion list method. We want to note that the outcomes in this study depend heavily on the design. First, the time taken for an assessment is strongly determined by the length of the criteria list used and the length of the texts (Breland, 1983). Not adaptive -->


<!-- Although the process of pairwise comparisons is quite easy and fast for raters to apply (@Laming_2004; @Pollitt_2004), even without training, the increase in time investment that is needed for CJ decreases its feasibility in educational practice. -->

<!-- @Bramley_2008 proposes ranking instead of comparisons -->


<!-- talk about the number of comparisons @Verhavert_et_al_2019, @Crompvoets_et_al_2022, @Pollitt_2004 -->


<!-- @Pollitt_2012b concludes that speed is not related to the quality of assessments in pairwise comparisons -->


<!-- All studies use SSR as a measure of reliability -->


<!-- It is assumed that the single observer compares each pair of stimuli a sufficient number of times so that a proportion may be determined for each pair [@Thurstone_1927b, pp. 267]. -->

<!-- "Another challenge to the intrinsic validity argument is that the aggregate approach and valuing of diversity in expert views (Van Daal et al., 2019) is in tension with the idea of removing misfitting judges (Pollitt, 2012a). If someone is considered an expert, and the validity of comparative judgment rests on the collective expertise of a community of practice, the decision to remove them and discard their judgments can only be justifiable on the assumption that those judgments do not reflect their expertise. ... It is thus unclear whether or not this divergence is welcomed." [@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 681] -->

<!-- We advocate for the no removal of judges, but rather identify them and treat the data with the appropriate model, so these 'misfits' do not affect the measurement of the trait -->



## Limitations and further research {#sec-discuss-limitations}


<!-- The field of comparative judgment, while growing, is still relatively small, and at present we do not have compelling answers to fundamental questions such as: how many judges do we need? Who should judge? How many judgments should they make? And crucially, how can we be confident that they are basing their judgments on acceptable criteria? If judges are not using construct-relevant criteria, then the argument that comparative judgments are necessarily valid cannot be upheld. We recognise that there is unlikely to be a single answer to these questions for all the cases in which comparative judgment may be used. However, work to derive some general principles for good practice would be valuable.[@Kelly_et_al_2022, pp. 683] -->
