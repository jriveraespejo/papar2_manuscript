# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

<!-- 1. What is comparative judgment? -->
In contemporary contexts, Thurstone's law of comparative judgment [-@Thurstone_1927] primarily refers to the method of *dichotomous* comparative judgment [DCJ, @Pollitt_2012a; @Pollitt_2012b]. In DCJ, a judge assesses the relative manifestation of a *trait* within a pair of stimuli. This assessment results in a dichotomous value indicating which stimulus possesses a higher degree of the trait. After different judges perform multiple rounds of pairwise comparisons, an outcome vector is produced. This vector is modeled using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model [BTL, @Bradley_et_al_1952; @Luce_1959], which creates a score that corresponds with the trait of interest. This score is then used to rank the stimuli from lowest to highest or to evaluate the influence of certain variables on the stimuli's positions in the ranking.

<!-- 2. in what has been applied on?, and where is the gap? -->
DCJ has proven effective in assessing competencies and traits predominantly within the educational realm, as demonstrated by @Pollitt_2012b, @Jones_2015, @vanDaal_et_al_2016, @Bartholomew_et_al_2018, @Lesterhuis_2018, @Bartholomew_et_al_2020, and @Marshall_et_al_2020. However, its application transcends education, as exemplified by @Boonen_et_al_2020. The methodology has also evolved to include multiple, as opposed to pairwise comparisons [@Luce_1959; @Placket_1975], and to accommodate comparisons with ordinal outcomes [@Tutz_1986; @Agresti_1992]. Overall, research suggests that DCJ offers an alternative and efficient approach to measurement and evaluation, characterized by its reliability and validity [@Lesterhuis_2018; @vanDaal_2020; @Marshall_et_al_2020; @Bouwer_et_al_2023]. Nevertheless, despite the method's widespread use, existing literature lacks a clear representation of the plausible mechanisms through which DCJ data could be generated. Particularly, there is no depiction of the complexity and the assumptions underpinning the DCJ system, nor how different assessment factors can potentially influence the observed DCJ outcome.

<!-- 3. What are the factors behind DCJ? -->
According to @Verhavert_et_al_2019 and @vanDaal_2020, several assessment factors interact and influence the method's outcome. These factors include the number and characteristics of the stimuli, their *proximity* in terms of the assessed trait, the number of comparison per stimulus, and the pairing algorithm used. Furthermore, since the method relies on judges' assessments, the number and characteristics of judges, their *discrimination* abilities, and the number of comparisons per judge also play pivotal roles. Moreover, when the stimuli represent sub-units of higher-levels units, factors such as the number and characteristics of these units, along with their *proximity* in terms of the assessed trait, can significantly influence the outcome. For instance, @vanDaal_et_al_2016 assessed academic writing skills of university students (units) using multiple argumentative essays (sub-units).

<!-- 4. Solution to the gap -->
Although several studies have examined the individual impact of these factors on the method's reliability [@Bramley_2015; @Pollitt_2012b; @Bramley_et_al_2019; @Verhavert_et_al_2019; @Crompvoets_et_al_2022; @vanDaal_et_al_2017; @Gijsen_et_al_2021; @Bouwer_et_al_2023], none, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have provided a transparent depiction of the DCJ system and the mechanisms generating the DCJ outcome. This study aims to fill this gap by representing DCJ within the framework of causal inference. Specifically, utilizing the structural approach, the study develops a scientific model to clarify plausible causal assumptions and mechanisms inherent in the DCJ system. The study then translates the scientific model into a probabilistic statistical model. This model aims to produce statistical estimates to draw inferences about plausible causal relationships within the DCJ system. 

<!-- 5. final objective and relevance -->
Ultimately, this study provides a robust causal and probabilistic foundation for the statistical analysis of DCJ data, building upon Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment [-@Thurstone_1927]. Consequently, its findings offer valuable insights for researchers and analysts designing and implementing DCJ experiments.


# Theoretical framework {#sec-framework}

This section introduces fundamental concepts in causal inference, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), structural causal models (SCMs), and the flow of association and causation in graphs. The section is not a comprehensive description of causal inference methods. Readers interested in deeper exploration should consult introductory papers like @Pearl_2010, @Rohrer_2018, @Pearl_2019, and @Cinelli_et_al_2020. They may also find introductory books such as @Pearl_et_al_2018, @Neal_2020 and @McElreath_2020 useful. For more advanced study, seminal intermediate papers like @Neyman_et_al_1923, @Rubin_1974, @Spirtes_et_al_1991, and @Sekhon_2009, as well as books such as @Pearl_2009, @Morgan_et_al_2014 and @Hernan_et_al_2020 are recommended.

## The structural approach to causal inference {#sec-framework-structural}

<!-- 1. What is causal inference? -->
In statistics, *causal inference* refers to the process of identifying the causes of a phenomenon and estimating their effects using data [@Shaughnessy_et_al_2010; @Neal_2020]. Unlike classical statistical modeling, which focuses solely on summarizing data and inferring associations, causal inference provides a coherent mathematical notation for analyzing causes and counterfactuals [@Pearl_2009]. 

<!-- 2. what are counterfactuals? -->
Counterfactuals represent scenarios *contrary to fact*, where alternative *potential* outcomes resulting from a cause are neither observed nor observable [@Neal_2020; @Counterfactual_2024]. According to @Pearl_et_al_2018, counterfactuals are the foundation of causal inference and occupy the highest level of cognitive abstraction in the ladder of causation, followed by intervention and association. Nevertheless, despite their abstract nature, counterfactuals enable the development of a *theory of the world* that explains why specific causes have specific effects and what occurs in their absence [@Pearl_et_al_2018]. They achieve this by translating causal statements into counterfactual statements, that is, statements about "what would have happened in the world under different circumstances."

<!-- 3. How do we apply causal inference and counterfactuals? -->
Several approaches to causal inference and counterfactuals exist, but two are particularly prominent: the potential outcomes approach, also known as the Neyman-Rubin causal model [@Neyman_et_al_1923; @Rubin_1974], and the structural approach [@Pearl_2009; @Pearl_et_al_2016]. Both approaches employ rigorous mathematical notation to characterize causal inference, but they do so in different ways [@Neal_2020]. The potential outcomes approach relies on counterfactual notation, whereas the structural approach employs the do-operator and structural causal models [SCM, @Pearl_2009; @Pearl_et_al_2016]. Despite these differences, both notations can be expressed in terms of the other, and both approaches provide methods for using experimental and observational data to estimate causal effects [@Pearl_2010]. 

<!-- 4. But which approach are we going to use? -->
Nevertheless, the structural approach offers an additional key advantage over the potential outcomes approach: it enables the graphical representation of any system through directed acyclic graphs [DAG, @Gross_et_al_2018; @Neal_2020]. DAGs serve as heuristics, effectively conveying the assumed causal structure of a system. A heuristic is a strategy that simplifies information to make decisions more quickly, efficiently, and sometimes more accurately than complex methods [@Chow_2015]. Consequently, DAGs do not represent detailed statistical models but allow researchers to deduce which statistical models can provide valid causal inferences, assuming the causal structure depicted in the DAG is accurate [@McElreath_2020].

<!-- A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) allows for the transparent depiction of a system’s complexity, revealing its underlying assumptions and the plausible mechanisms generating the system’s outcome, assuming the DAG is true.  -->

## DAGs and SCMs {#sec-framework-dag}

<!-- 1. Graph theory and the use of graphs -->
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of graphs. Graphs are mathematical structures modeling pairwise relations between objects. They can represent physical relations, such as electrical circuits and roadways, and less tangible structures, such as ecosystems and sociological relations. Graphs have proven useful in various fields, including computer science, operations research, and the natural and social sciences [@Gross_et_al_2018]. 

<!-- 2. What does the structural approach uses?, and what are DAGs? -->
In statistics, one application incorporating concepts from graph theory is causal inference. Specifically, the structural approach to causal inference uses directed acyclic graphs (DAG), and their associated structural causal models (SCM), to provide a graphical and formal representation of the causal structure of a system [@Neal_2020]. In this context, a *graph* denotes a collection of nodes connected by edges, where nodes represent random variables. The term *directed* indicates the edges of the graph extend from one node to another, with arrows showing the direction of causal influence. Moreover, the term *acyclic* indicates the causal influences do not form a loop, meaning the influences do not cycle back on themselves [@McElreath_2020].

<!-- 3. how DAGs can be depicted? -->
<!-- 3.1 the simplified DAG -->
Regardless of complexity, DAGs can represent various causal structures using only five fundamental building blocks [@Neal_2020; @McElreath_2020]. The left panels of @fig-dags_scms illustrate these building blocks using the *standard* representation [@Morgan_et_al_2014]. In these graphs, the variables of interest, or *endogenous* variables $V=\{X,Z,Y\}$, are depicted as solid black circles to signify that they are observed random variables. The arrows in the graphs reflect the expected direction of causal influences among these variables.

<!-- 3.2 the magnified DAG -->
In contrast, the middle panels of @fig-dags_scms present the building blocks using the *magnified* representation. These graphs incorporate *exogenous* variables $E=\{e_{X},e_{Z},e_{Y}\}$, depicted as open circles to signify their unobserved nature. Exogenous variables represent *errors* or *disturbances* arising from omitted factors that the investigator chooses not to model explicitly [@Pearl_2009, pp. 27,68]. Thus, they can be viewed as the 'idiosyncratic' causes of each variable. Although these variables are often omitted for simplicity, as illustrated in the left panels, including them in the graphs can be beneficial, as their presence can reveal potential issues related to conditioning and confounding [@Cinelli_et_al_2020], concepts explored in the next section.

<!-- Lastly, the right panels of @fig-dags_scms present the building blocks using the SCM representation. SCMs are  -->

<!-- 4. What are the advantages of DAGs? -->
<!-- DAGs can represent causal relations in a nonparametric and fully interactive manner. This means that feasible causal analysis strategies usually do not require specifying the type of data or the nature of the functional dependence among variables. This generality allows for modeling causality without assuming a specific functional form [@Morgan_et_al_2014].  -->


<!-- 5. But what does the building blocks mean? -->
A careful examination of the left and middle panels of @fig-dags_scms reveals the assumption inherent in these building blocks. Figures [-@fig-sdag_bb1] and [-@fig-mdag_bb1] depict two unconnected nodes, representing a scenario where variables $X$ and $Y$ are not causally related. Figures [-@fig-sdag_bb2] and [-@fig-mdag_bb2] show two connected nodes, illustrating a scenario where a parent node $X$ exerts a causal influence on a child node $Y$. Consequently, $Y$ is considered a *descendant* of $X$. Figures [-@fig-sdag_bb3] and [-@fig-mdag_bb3] depict a *chain* (or *pipe*), where $X$ influences $Z$, and $Z$ influences $Y$. In this configuration, $X$ is a parent node of $Z$, and $Z$ is a parent node of $Y$. Furthermore, the DAG shows that $X$ is an *ancestor* of $Y$ and that $Z$ completely *mediates* the relationship between these variables. Figures [-@fig-sdag_bb4] and [-@fig-mdag_bb4] illustrate a *fork*, where variables $X$ and $Y$ are both influenced by $Z$. In this scenario, $Z$ is a parent node of $X$ and $Y$. Finally, Figures [-@fig-sdag_bb5] and [-@fig-mdag_bb5] depict a *collider*, also known as *inmorality*, where variables $X$ and $Y$ are concurrent causes of $Z$. In this configuration, $X$ and $Y$ are not causally related to each other but both influence $Z$. 


<!-- 5. A motivating example -->
Given the heuristic nature of DAGs, a motivating example can help illustrate the use of the five fundamental building blocks to construct a system's causal structure. This example can also help to clarify some additional conventions for drawing DAGs.

Consider a research problem where the causal effect of a variable $T$ on an outcome $Y$ needs to be investigated. Additionally, the problem suggests that a variable $X$ potentially influences both $T$ and $Y$. Such scenarios are not hard to imagine. For instance, $T$ might represent different treatments that could affect the recovery from cancer $Y$, while $X$ could denote the patient's age. Similarly, in the context of a DCJ study like the one described by @Boonen_et_al_2020, $T$ could represent the duration of a child's cochlear implant use, which might influence the child's overall speech quality $Y$, with $X$ indicating the child's hearing status. [(not a bad example, but I prefer one using writing skills)]{style="color:blue;"}

<!-- 6. DAG for the motivating example -->
@fig-example presents two graphs illustrating the plausible causal structure of the motivating example. @fig-sdag_example1 shows the *simplified* graph, while @fig-mdag_example1 depicts the *magnified* graph of the DAG. A detailed examination of both figures reveals the presence of at least four of the five fundamental building blocks. @fig-sdag_example1 displays multiple descendants, evident in pairwise relations such as $X \rightarrow T$, $X \rightarrow Y$, and $T \rightarrow Y$. It also illustrates a fork with $X \rightarrow \{T,Y\}$. Similarly, @fig-mdag_example1 features multiple two-unconnected nodes, evident in the pairwise relations $\{e_{T} \dsep e_{X}\}$, $\{e_{T} \dsep e_{Y}\}$, and $\{e_{X} \dsep e_{Y}\}$, as well as colliders such as $\{X,e_{T}\} \rightarrow T$ and $\{X,T,e_{Y}\} \rightarrow Y$. The symbol $\dsep$ denotes a concept know as *d-separation*, which roughly implies the independence of the variables. This concept is introduced in the next section.

<!-- Initially, it defines the different targets of inference (i.e., the *estimands*), which form the basis for evaluating the reliability of the DCJ method. The targets  Subsequently, the research constructs a *scientific model* for the DCJ procedure, elucidating the causal assumptions and mechanisms underlying the system, aiding in drawing inferences about causal relationships from DCJ data. Next, the study translates the scientific model into a probabilistic statistical model (i.e., an *estimator*) to derive a *statistical estimand* for the various inference targets. Bayesian statistical methods offer an intuitive approach for the task. Finally, employing multiple simulated datasets for different combinations of the relevant assessment factors, the study generates multiple *estimates* or approximations for the statistical estimands. Notably, the statistical estimands in simulated data are known, enabling the study to assess the reliability of DCJ by evaluating the *proximity* of these estimands to the generated estimates, resembling a power analysis. -->


<!-- In this context, identification refers to the process of moving from a (causal) *estimand* to an equivalent *statistical estimand*, and estimation refers to the process of moving from a *statistical estimand* to an *estimate*. -->

# Theory {#sec-theory}

## A scientific model for the DCJ {#sec-theory-scientific}


<!-- A *scientific (causal) model* describe the causal assumptions and mechanisms underlying a system, and facilitate inferences about causal relationships from data [@Hitchcock_2023]. -->

<!-- From Lawson (2015), another way to see DCJ experiments I'd that you are grouping heterogeneous experimental units (objects) into homogeneous ones (subjects), which are your "blocks" -->

<!-- Assuming certain values are decided in the experimental design (proportions, sample size, etc) you can reduce the graph -->



<!-- It is more likely that we can decide the characteristics of the objects we want to include in the study (independent variables), ensuring groups that are more balanced. However, in the case of subjects sometimes the independent variables cannot be assigned (e.g., hearing status) -->


## Probabilitics assumptions of the scientific model {#sec-theory-probability}

<!-- what does it mean in probabilistic terms? describe probabilities and arrive to structural model -->

<!-- Final models does not require the estimation of latent variables, the results can be evaluated without them -->

<!-- Notice that latent variables are kind of like descendants -->

## From the scientific to statistical model {#sec-theory-statistics}

<!-- "An appropriate analysis of data cannot be completed without knowledge of what experimental design was used and how the data was collected, and conclusions are not reliable if they are not justified by the proper modeling and analysis of the data" (Lawson, 2015, p. 7) -->

<!-- "In many cases where observational units are different than the experimental units, the observational units will not be independent" (p. 177) -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!--   O_{kijr_{ij}} \sim & \; \text{Bernoulli}\left[ \; logit^{-1}\left( \delta_{kijr_{ij}} \right) \; \right] \\ -->
<!--   \delta_{kijr_{ij}} = & \; \gamma_{k}( \theta_{ir_{i}} - \theta_{jr_{j}} ) \\ -->
<!--   \gamma_{k} = & \; logit^{-1}\left[ \beta_{Z} Z_{k} + e_{k} \right] \\ -->

<!-- for identification purposes we can set $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{k(g)} = 0.02$, $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{i(g)} = 1$, and $\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^{G} \sigma_{r(g)} = 1$. A special case of this would be to assume that the data comes from the same population, in that case, $\sigma_{k(g)} = \sigma_{k} = 0.02$, $\sigma_{i(g)} = \sigma_{i} = 1$ -->




## Let's talk about Thurstone {#sec-theory-thurstone}


<!-- Thurstone's comparative judgment @Thurstone_1927 is based on the formula: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- X_{AB} = \frac{S_{A} - S_{B}}{\sigma_{AB}} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- where $X_{AB}$ defines the comparative judgment outcome, $S_{A}$ and $S_{B}$ are the modal discriminal processes, $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B} + 2 \rho \sigma_{A} \sigma_{B}}$, with $\sigma_{A}$ and $\sigma_{B}$ being the dispersion of discriminal processes $A$ and $B$, respectively, and $\rho$ the correlation between discriminal processes.    -->

<!-- The theory identifies five cases: -->

<!-- - **Case 1:** only constant $\rho$ (not $\rho_{ij}$) -->
<!-- - **Case 2:** $X_{ij}$ becomes $X_{kij}$ with $k=1, \dots, K$ judges (replication, not duplication) -->
<!-- - **Case 3:** $\rho = 0$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B}}$  -->
<!-- - **Case 4:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}+d$, then $\lim_{d \leq 0.1\sigma_{A}} \sigma_{AB} = (\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) /\sqrt{2}$ -->
<!-- - **Case 5:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{2}\sigma$ -->

<!-- Now using the DAG and statistical notation -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!--   O_{kijr_{ij}} := & \; f_{O}( \delta_{kijr_{ij}} ) \\ -->
<!--   \delta_{kijr_{ij}} = & \; \gamma_{k}( \theta_{ir_{i}} - \theta_{jr_{j}} ) \\ -->
<!--   \gamma_{k} = & \; f_{G}( Z_{k}, e_{k} ) \\ -->
<!--   \theta_{ir_{i}} = & \; \theta_{i} + \beta_{Y} Y_{r} + e_{r_{i}}  \\ -->
<!--   \theta_{i} = & \; \beta_{X} X_{i} + e_{i}  \\ -->
<!--   e_{k} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{k(g)}) \\ -->
<!--   e_{i} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{i(g)}) \\ -->
<!--   e_{r_{i}} \sim & \; \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{r(g)}) -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ {#eq-StatModel_thurstone} -->

<!-- The theory identifies five cases: -->

<!-- - **Case 1:** only constant $\rho \approx \sigma_{i}$ -->
<!-- - **Case 2:** now judges are separated by using $\gamma_{k}$ -->
<!-- - **Case 3:** $\rho \approx \sigma_{e_{i}} = 0$ (no nesting of texts on students), then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{ \sigma^{2}_{A} + \sigma^{2}_{B}}$  -->
<!-- - **Case 4:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}+d$, then $\lim_{d \leq 0.1\sigma_{A}} \sigma_{AB} = (\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) /\sqrt{2}$ -->
<!-- - **Case 5:** $\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{A}$, then $\sigma_{AB} = \sqrt{2}\sigma$ -->

<!-- But now can we see other scenarios than just those 5 cases? -->

<!-- - consider different $\rho \approx \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sigma_{p}$, depending on $P$ nesting structures  -->
<!-- - we can now investigate $\gamma_{k}$ -->
<!-- - we can assume $\sigma_{B} \neq \sigma_{A}$, no need for results on the limit -->


# Discussion {#sec-discuss}

## Findings {#sec-discuss-finding}

<!-- no fundamental ontological objections to using DAGs to describe causal models and causal relationships. -->

## Limitations and further research {#sec-discuss-limitations}
<!-- and most of the methods depend on unverifiable assumptions, causal inference can still identify causes and estimate their effects, assuming a set of plausibles mechanisms for a system. -->
